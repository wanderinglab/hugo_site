After teaching as faculty at different universities, Prof. Santerre wanted to create an opportunity for his former Masters students who were interested in pursuing a PhD to collaborate.  Styled after the research teams John has been part of at Carnegie Mellon , Uni. Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, Wandering Lab is focused on Machine Learning research.  The goal is to provide direction and support as students transition from professional masters programs to PhD studies through their contribution to ML research.
